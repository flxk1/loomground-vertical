"""Requirements house — a structured tree of what an instrument requires.

The NDs produce flat atoms: obligation pairs, required-artifact pairs,
cross-references. This module *assembles* them into a "house": a set of
**rooms**, where each room is a requirement node — a thing the org must do or
produce — with its obligations, the artifact it calls for, and its
cross-references all hanging under it.

A room is keyed, in order of preference, to:
  1. the instrument's own architecture — an Akoma Ntoso ``eId`` / article number
     (so room = "Article 9: Risk Management System"), when the source was parsed
     structure-aware; else
  2. a required-artifact (room = "DPIA", "Technical Documentation"); else
  3. the obligation's bearer + a hash (a bare-obligation room).

Why this shape: it turns "47 obligations" into "8 rooms you must furnish",
which is what a compliance owner actually plans against — and it gives the
coverage mapper concrete targets to place documents into. Every room traces to
a source provision, so the house is auditable, not a vibe-grouping.

Assembly only — no new judgment. Deterministic. The room taxonomy is domain
data (the required-artifact catalogue), so the same builder works for any
domain's NDs.
