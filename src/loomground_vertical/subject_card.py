"""Subject card — the structured description of the thing being assessed.

The instrument side (the AI Act) is already typed obligation pairs. To produce a
"where does my system sit" memo, the *subject* side must be typed too, in the
SAME controlled vocabulary the obligations key on — otherwise matching is
prose-against-prose guesswork.

EU regulation is written as **role × artifact-class × activity** (Article 6,
Annex III, and the obligation articles all key on those). The card mirrors that
shape, so matching becomes set-against-set (deterministic, auditable) rather
than a model deciding "does this apply".

This module is domain-parameterised. The AI Act vocabulary ships here as the
first instance (:data:`AI_ACT_VOCAB`); other domains (GDPR processing activity,
a contract, a trademark) register their own vocabulary and reuse the same card
shape + the matcher unchanged. That is what makes the memo generalise.

The card is also the single place a human corrects the assessment, and the
record the audit log pins as "what we assessed".
